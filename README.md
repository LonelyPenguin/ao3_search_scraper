# ao3_search_scraper
Quick and dirty script to extract a single term from every work/entry on an Archive Of Our Own search result. Can be customized to scrape other simple paginated sites.
See comments within script for use instructions.

Useful to collect data on the frequency of various authors within a work tag, or other things I haven't thought of.

Sorts results alphabetically using the Python list.sort() method.
